HelloðŸ™‚

# Welcome the "Cytaka Scoreboard" project #

Thanks for stopping by.

This project is one of my freelance ones. I worked with a company which called "Cytaka".
The company is running national cyber competitions. I was asked to design and develop
self updating scoreboard which takes data from a database that gets updated during the competition. 

This is one of my very first frontend related work.

Technologies: React.js, CSS.

The interface is written in Hebrew. I am sorry in advance if you can't understand it.
